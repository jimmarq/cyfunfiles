Have you ever had to write
a really long essay and you
feel like you need to stretch
out the sentences as far as
you can by including words
that do not add as much value
to the overall produce as 
perhaps they should given the
importance of the final result
to your overall grade? Well,
you are not alone, meaning that
other people have had the same
experience, or in other words,
it is common to have such
feelings. In other words, your
experience does not differ
substantially from what many
others have felt. Thank you
for coming to my Ted Talk.
