# Exercise: Dictionary Operations

# Create a dictionary named `address` that has the following key/value pairs when initialized:
#   city: Marquette
#   state: Michigan
#   zip: 49855 (a string)
#   population: 43 (an integer)
# For readability, put each key/value pair on a new line.
# (This will be one logical line of code spread over several lines.)

address = ?

# Print the dictionary

# Print the value of `city` from the dictionary.

# Print the value of `state` from the dictionary.

# Print the value of `zip` from the dictionary.
