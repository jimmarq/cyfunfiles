## Editing Python Files

Vim and nano can be used to edit python files just fine. But, some programs make editing python files easier. Microsoft created Visual Studio Code as a general-purpose code editor. It works well with python. Visual Studio Code builds on an open-source codebase. The code-oss application retains includes only the open-source parts. It can be installed in many Linux distributions, including Kali. Details can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode.

Run the following command in the terminal to install code-oss.

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code-oss
```

Run the program with the following command:

```sh
code-oss
```
