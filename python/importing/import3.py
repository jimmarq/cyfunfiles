# Exercise: Importing Packages

# In this exercise, you will import the math package
# to help calculate the area of a circle.

# Step 1: Import the math package


# Step 2: Print the value of pi (from the math package)


# Step 3: Calculate the area of a circle
# Create a variable called 'radius' and assign it a value of 5


# Step 4: Calculate the area of a circle using the math package
# Calculate the area using the formula: area = pi * radius^2
# (Remember to use the python notation for powers)


# Step 5: Print the calculated area
