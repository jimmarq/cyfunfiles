# In this exercise, you will be given a
# number and you need to write a loop
# that counts down from that number to 1.
# Your task is to complete the missing 
# code below to implement the countdown
# functionality using a while loop.

# The user is prompted for a number
number = int(input("Enter a number greater than 0: "))
# Write a while loop that counts down
# from the number until 0. When zero 
# is reached, the loop should exit.
# Print each number as the loop counts
# down.

# The following message will be printed.
print("Countdown complete!")
