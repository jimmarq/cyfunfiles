# Exercise: String Creation
# Write the python code to store the following text in a string.
# Give each string the name of your first name and a unique number.
# For example, I would use jim1, jim2, jim3, etc.
# Print each string variable. An example is included below.

# Hello, there.
jim1 = "Hello, there"
print(jim1)

# I am Dave.

# I'm Dave.

# I said, "No way I'm gonna do that."

# That's impossible

# It was the "best" cake she'd ever seen.
