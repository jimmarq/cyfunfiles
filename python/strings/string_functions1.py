# Create a new string variable with your first name (lower case).
# The value should be your full name.
# For example, if you name was Pat Parker, the variable
# would be pat, and the value would be Pat Parker.


# Store the upper case version of the string variable
# in a new variable named up1. Use the built-in string
# function to convert the string variable to upper case.


# Store the lower case version of the string variable
# in a new variable named down1. Use the built-in string
# function to convert the string variable to lower case.


# Print all string variables


# Print the count of characters in your name using
# the built-in function.
