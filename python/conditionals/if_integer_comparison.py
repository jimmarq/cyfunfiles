# Exercise: Comparison Operators

# In this exercise, you need to write
# Python code to compare two numbers 
# using different comparison operators.

# Step 1: The variables `a` and `b` 
# have been declared for you.
a = 5
b = 10

# Step 2: Check if 'a' is equal to 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is equal to b.")

# Step 3: Check if 'a' is not equal to 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is not equal to b.")

# Step 4: Check if 'a' is greater than 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is greater than b.")

# Step 5: Check if 'a' is less than 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is less than b.")

# Step 6: Check if 'a' is 
# greater than or equal to 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b.")

# Step 7: Check if 'a' is 
# less than or equal to 'b'
if ?:
    print("a is less than or equal to b.")
