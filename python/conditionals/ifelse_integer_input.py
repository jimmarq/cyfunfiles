# Comparison Operators Exercise
# In this exercise, you will be given two integers 'a' and 'b'.
# Your task is to write Python code to check and print whether 'a' is greater than, equal to, or less than 'b'.
# Example:
# a = 5, b = 3 => Output: a is greater than b

# 1. Take input for 'a' and 'b' from the user.
a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))

# 2. Use if-elif-else statements to determine the relationship between 'a' and 'b'.
# 3. Use the comparison operators: >, <, and == to check the relationship.
# 4. Print the appropriate message based on the relationship between 'a' and 'b'.
