# Exercise: String Comparisons with If/Else

# Prompt the user to enter two strings
string1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
string2 = input("Enter the second string: ")
print(string1)
print(string2)

# Compare the length of the two strings
# If they are the same length, print: "The lengths of the two strings are equal."
# If string1 is longer, print: "The first string is longer than the second string."
# Otherwise, print: "The second string is longer than the first string."


# Compare the two strings alphabetically
# If string1 comes first alphabetically, print: "The first string comes before the second string."
# If string1 comes second alphabetically, print: "The second string comes before the first string."
# Otherwise, print: "The two strings are equal."
