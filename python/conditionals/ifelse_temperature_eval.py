# Exercise: Temperature Evaluation

# In this exercise, you are given a 
# variable `temperature` that 
# represents the current temperature
# in Celsius.
#
# Your task is to complete the code 
# by writing a conditional statement
# that evaluates the temperature and
# prints the appropriate message based
# on the following conditions:
#
# If the temperate is:
#  - zero or lower
#    - print "It's freezing!"
#  - over 0 and up to 10 degrees Celsius (inclusive)
#    - print "It's cold."
#  - between 11 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive)
#    - print "It's cool."
#  - between 21 and 30 degrees Celsius (inclusive)
#    - print "It's warm."
#  - above 30 degrees Celsius
#    - print "It's hot!"

# Sample temperature
temperature = 25
