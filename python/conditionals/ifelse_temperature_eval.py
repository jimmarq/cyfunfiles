# Exercise: Temperature Evaluation

# In this exercise, you are given a variable `temperature` that represents the current temperature in Celsius.
# Your task is to complete the code by writing a conditional statement that evaluates the temperature and prints the appropriate message based on the following conditions:
# - If the temperature is below freezing (less than 0 degrees Celsius), print "It's freezing!"
# - If the temperature is between 0 and 10 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print "It's cold."
# - If the temperature is between 11 and 20 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print "It's cool."
# - If the temperature is between 21 and 30 degrees Celsius (inclusive), print "It's warm."
# - If the temperature is above 30 degrees Celsius, print "It's hot!"

# Sample temperature
temperature = 25
