# Complete the code to accomplish the tasks described.

# 1. Define two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any integer values.
num1 = ?
num2 = ?

# 2. Perform addition of num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable called sum_result.
sum_result = ?

# 3. Perform subtraction of num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable called diff_result.
diff_result = ?

# 4. Perform multiplication of num1 and num2 and store the result in a variable called prod_result.
prod_result = ?

# 5. Perform integer division of num1 by num2 and store the result in a variable called div_result.
div_result = ?

# 6. Print the values of sum_result, diff_result, prod_result, div_result, and mod_result.
print("Sum Result:", sum_result)
print("Difference Result:", diff_result)
print("Product Result:", prod_result)
print("Division Result:", div_result)
