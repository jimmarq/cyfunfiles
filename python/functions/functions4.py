# Exercise: Function Creation

# Instructions:
# 1. Write a function called 
#    "check_number" that takes 
#    one parameter, "num".
# 2. The function should check
#    if the input number is 
#    positive, negative, or zero.
# 3. If the number is positive, 
#    the function should print,
#    "The number is positive".
# 4. If the number is negative,
#    the function should print,
#    "The number is negative".
# 5. If the number is zero, 
#    the function should print,
#    "The number is zero".
# 6. After defining the function,
#    call it with different arguments
#    to test your code.

# Write your code below this line:



# The following code should test the fuction.

# Output: The number is positive
check_number(5)

# Output: The number is negative
check_number(-3)

# Output: The number is zero
check_number(0)
